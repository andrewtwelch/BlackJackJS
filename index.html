      This is a small, mostly JavaScript based project that I completed in aproximately 8 hours.<br />
      The code is horrible, but if you want to have a look visit <a href="https://github.com/andrewtwelch/BlackJackJS">https://github.com/andrewtwelch/BlackJackJS</a>.</br>
      It doesn't include doubling down or insurance, I might add that later though.
